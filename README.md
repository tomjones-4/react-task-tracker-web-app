# Simple Todo App built with React

## How It Works

### `npm start` or `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser (or [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) if using yarn).

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Possible Improvements

* Keep track of ongoing tasks
* Add authentication
* Lists
* Tasks
* Subtasks
