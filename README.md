# Simple Todo App built with React

## How it Works

### `npm start` or `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser (or [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) if using yarn).

The app is also deployed on Vercel: https://react-todo-app-psi-snowy.vercel.app/

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any errors in the console.

## Tips on Usage
* Lists and tasks can be reordered. Drag them by gripping the "drag" icon that shows up on the right side when hovering over a list or task.
* Only the tasks that are associated with the selected list are shown. To see all tasks, make sure the "All Tasks" list is selected.
* The tags on the menu also filter what tasks are shown. Only tasks in the selected list that have at least one of the selected tags will be shown.
* The search box overrides any list and tags filtering. It will unselect all tags and change the selected list to "All Tasks".
* There is a divider that can be dragged left and right to resize the main view and task view.
