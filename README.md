# Task Tracker Web App built with React

## How to Access the App
* The app is hosted online by Vercel: https://react-todo-app-psi-snowy.vercel.app/
* Running `npm start` or `yarn dev` in the terminal starts the app locally in the development mode.
  * Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser (or [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) if using yarn).

## Tips on Usage
* Data will be saved on the browser (i.e. Google Chrome, Safari, etc.). It will persist unless the user clears their browser history/data.
* Lists and tasks can be reordered. Drag them by gripping the "drag" icon that shows up on the right side when hovering over a list or task.
* Only the tasks that are associated with the selected list are shown. To see all tasks, make sure the "All Tasks" list is selected.
* The tags on the menu also filter what tasks are shown. Only tasks in the selected list that have at least one of the selected tags will be shown.
* The search box overrides any list and tags filtering. It will unselect all tags and change the selected list to "All Tasks".
* There is a divider that can be dragged left and right to resize the main view and task view.

## Important Notes
* This app was designed and developed for use on desktop. Usage on mobile is discouraged.
